# Bengali Vocal Spectrum (BVS): A Bengali Voice Dataset for Psychological Stability Analysis

## üìä Project Overview

This project provides a detailed implementation of **feature extraction** from audio recordings for psychological stability analysis using the **Bengali Vocal Spectrum (BVS)** dataset. The focus is on creating **spectrograms** from `.wav` audio files to extract frequency and temporal features critical for machine learning models.

### Key Steps in Feature Extraction:
1. **Audio Preprocessing**:
   - Audio files are loaded using `librosa` at a sampling rate of 48,000 Hz.
   - Segmentation is applied to divide audio files into **2-second clips** for finer analysis.

2. **Spectrogram Generation**:
   - **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** is applied to extract frequency and amplitude variations over time.
   - Spectrograms are converted into decibel scale (logarithmic) for better visualization and machine learning compatibility.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Each spectrogram is saved as a `.png` image for exploratory analysis and model training.
   - The x-axis represents time frames (seconds), while the y-axis represents frequency components.

4. **Output**:
   - Spectrograms for each audio file are saved in structured folders:
     - `data/Stable/` for psychologically stable recordings.
     - `data/Unstable/` for psychologically unstable recordings.

## üìÑ Dataset Access:
The dataset is publicly available on **Mendeley Data**:
- **Direct URL**: [BVS Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/s5j25b5tjk/1)

### üìä Key Highlights:
- **Ethical Data Collection**: Approved by mental health institutions in Bangladesh.
- **High-Quality Preprocessing**: Ensures clarity and consistency across recordings.
- **Balanced Dataset**: Equal representation of stable and unstable categories.
